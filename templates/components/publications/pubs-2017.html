            Statistics show that, on average, each user of Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCs) uses "jump-back" to navigate a course video for 2.6 times. By taking a closer look at the navigation data, we found that more than half of the jump-backs are due to the "bad" positions of the previous jump-backs. In this work, employing one of the largest Chinese MOOCs, XuetangX.com, as the source for our research, we study the extent to which we can develop a methodology to understand the user intention and help the user alleviate this problem by suggesting the best position for a jump-back. We demonstrate that it is possible to accurately predict 90% of users' jump-back intentions in the real online system. Moreover, our study reveals several interesting patterns, e.g., students in nonscience courses tend to jump back from the first half of the course video, and students in science courses tend to replay for longer time.

            Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCs), offering a new way to study online, are revolutionizing education. One challenging issue in MOOCs is how to design effective and fine-grained course concepts such that students with different backgrounds can grasp the essence of the course. In this paper, we conduct a systematic investigation of the problem of course concept extraction for MOOCs. We propose to learn latent representations for candidate concepts via an embedding-based method. Moreover, we develop a graph-based propagation algorithm to rank the candidate concepts based on the learned representations. We evaluate the proposed method using different courses from XuetangX and Coursera. Experimental results show that our method significantly outperforms all the alternative methods (+0.013-0.318 in terms of Rprecision; p << 0.01, t-test).

            What prerequisite knowledge should students achieve a level of mastery before moving forward to learn subsequent coursewares? We study the extent to which the prerequisite relation between knowledge concepts in Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCs) can be inferred automatically. In particular, what kinds of information can be leveraged to uncover the potential prerequisite relation between knowledge concepts. We first propose a representation learning-based method for learning latent representations of course concepts, and then investigate how different features capture the prerequisite relations between concepts. Our experiments on three datasets form Coursera show that the proposed method achieves significant improvements (+5.9-48.0% by F1-score) comparing with existing methods.

            Recommending courses to online students is a fundamental and also challenging issue in MOOCs. Not exactly like recommendation in traditional online systems, students who enrolled the same course may have very different purposes and with very different backgrounds. For example, one may want to study "data mining" after studying the course of "big data analytics" because the former is a prerequisite course of the latter, while some other may choose "data mining" simply because of curiosity.
            <br />
            Employing the complete data from XuetangX, one of the largest MOOCs in China, we conduct a systematic investigation on the problem of student behavior modeling for course recommendation. We design a content-aware algorithm framework using content based users' access behaviors to extract user-specific latent information to represent students' interest profile. We also leverage the demographics and course prerequisite relation to better reveal users' potential choice. Finally, we develop a course recommendation algorithm based on the user interest, demographic profiles and course prerequisite relation using collaborative filtering strategy. Experiment results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm performs much better than several baselines (over 2X by MRR). We have deployed the recommendation algorithm onto the platform XuetangX as a new feature, which significantly helps improve the course recommendation performance (+24.6% by click rate) comparing with the recommendation strategy previously used in the system.
